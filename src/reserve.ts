/**
 * House reserve calculation. See SPEC.md "PLAN".
 *
 * reserve_kwh = forecast house load from `nowSlot` until the free window x safetyFactor
 * reserve_pct = ceil(reserve_kwh / batteryKwh * 100) + floor, clamped 10..100
 *
 * `floor` is the FoxESS minSocOnGrid (10% BMS minimum unless the owner raised
 * it). The house's energy sits ON TOP of it: the inverter won't discharge
 * below the floor, so a reserve AT the floor would leave the house on paid
 * grid until the free window (owner, 2026-09-27: never pull from grid because the
 * battery hit its minimum).
 *
 * Forecast per half-hour slot = mean of `samples` rows for that slot; the
 * caller passes rows already filtered to the days it wants averaged (e.g.
 * last 5 weekdays). Slots with no samples fall back to a flat 1.0 kW
 * (0.5 kWh/slot), which also covers the no-history bootstrap.
