/**
 * SOLAR_SOAK (after the free window, see SPEC): the battery is full and

 * can't see curtailed headroom, so the loop runs on the battery instead:
 *   batteryW = feedin - import - (pv - load)   (energy balance, + = discharging)
 * Discharging -> the car outran the sun: step down. Otherwise take visible
 * surplus (export, or PV into the battery), and while the battery is full
 * probe up 1 A per tick — the inverter un-curtails to meet the new load, or
 * the battery shows it next tick. The full battery is only a buffer:
 * SOAK_MIN_SOC is the hard stop, so the evening export and next morning's
 * dump are untouched.
 * soak_export 'false' (2026-10-05): export is worth keeping, so the car may
 * only eat PV the inverter is curtailing — observable as feed-in sitting at
 * the EXPORT_LIMIT_W cap with a full battery. The export term is dropped,
 * starts and probes need the cap reached, and feed-in falling below the cap
 * while charging means the car is eating export: step down, stop at the
 * minimum. Without the cap var curtailment is invisible, so no soak starts.
